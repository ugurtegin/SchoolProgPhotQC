# Single mode and multimode nonlinear beam propagation simulations
These are the example codes for the "Nonlinear Effects in Photonic Integrated Circuits" course on Tübitak School of Programmable Photonic Quantum Computers

## Code
Repository contains a time-dependent pulse propagation simulation for single mode fiber and time-independent beam propagation simulation for graded-index multimode fiber. The code is written in Python with the Numpy and Matplotlib libraries. 

## How to:

Use the shared notebooks containing the example code in Code/Experiments folder

* To obtain Figure 2 in the figure, please run the corresponding code under Code/Experiments directory with Sinc.zip file.
* To obtain Figure 3 in the figure, please run the corresponding code under Code/Experiments directory with Abalone.zip, Face.zip, Audio Digit.zip and Audio Speaker.zip files.
* To obtain Figure 4 in the figure, please run the corresponding code under Code/Experiments directory with Covid-19.zip file.
* To obtain Figure 6 in the figure, please run the corresponding code under Code/Simulations directory.
